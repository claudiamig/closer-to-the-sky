# Closer to the Sky
*A project for co-creating astronomical knowledge in favelas in Rio de Janeiro*

![Badge under development](http://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=STATUS&message=under%20Development&color=GREEN&style=for-the-badge)

## Welcome
Welcome to Closer to the Sky 🌟 This is an astronomy outreach project that aims at building a bridge between favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and universities/research centers via a mutually enriching approach. 

Science dissemination and education are brought into the favela while people of the favela are invited to co-create scientific content in collaboration with students, researchers and professors.

This approach promotes inclusion, values community knowledge and culture, and provides institutional support and protection to these fragile contexts.

This document (the README file) provides an introduction to the project:

## What are we doing?

### The problem
* Brazil is a country of great inequalities, social injustice and racial segregation. 
* In the favelas of Rio, children and teenagers have hardly any access to extracurricular courses beyond public school.
* In Brazil and elsewhere, public outreach and education projects engaging with marginalised communities are often conducted as sporadic events, imposing a preconceived notion of science rather than fostering an equitable exchange based on mutual trust and respect. 

### The solution
The potential of astronomy to inspire and fascinate scientists, artists and people around the world has been demonstrated to have a restorative power, contributing to people’s mental well-being, especially for marginalised social groups that live under extremely stressful conditions. Hence we intend to apply that potential in Rio's favelas. 

By offering extracurricular training courses and cultural experiences to children and people from the favela, engaging them in the scientific creation and providing positive role models of scientists from Afrodescendant backgrounds, we wish to enrich their school curriculum and strengthen the chance they wish to stay in education after secondary school. 

## Our main goals
* Improve mental well-being of children and teenagers in the favela
* Promote quality education, STEM and gender equality
* Support cultural work and empower people of the favela

## Running Actions
This project is being introduced in Ninho das Águias, a social-cultural project from the [PPG favela complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantagalo%E2%80%93Pav%C3%A3o%E2%80%93Pav%C3%A3ozinho), one of the city’s oldest and most densely populated slums, its origin directly linked to the slavery heritage of Brazil’s society. Located in Copacabana, it makes a huge contrast with one of the richest neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro.

[Ninho das Águias](https://universoacme.wixsite.com/ninhodasaguias/sobre) was designed by the urban artist Acme, dweller of the community. It promotes extracurricular courses for children and teenagers of PPG, such as art and dance classes, as well as classes of astronomy and English. 

### Friday classes

Every Friday, starting May 2023, we offer free astronomy classes at Ninho das Águias for children between 14-19 years old.

The classes cover the following topics:
* Constellations (indigenous constellations, official IAU constellations, meaning and 3D distrubition of stars)
* Solar System (fix stars vs planet, kepler vs copernicus - the importance of quality data collection, the origin of water/water memories)
* Stars and the stellar life cycle (the origin of chemical elements, what are we made of?, are we really equal?, planetary nebulae - art collaboration)  
* Scales in astronomy: star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters (the distance ladder, Henrietta Levit and women in astronomy)
* Origin of the Universe
* Gravity and the Hubble law
* Light andd the electromaagnetic spectrum 
* Heat and maagnetism


### Library
The project hosts a library that aims to stimulate reading among children and tenagers from PPG. Futhermore, it holds material, thanks to funding from the International Astronomical Union (OruMbya: a library of silenced voices, https://www.astro4dev.org/orumbya-library-of-silenced-voices/), that presents marginalized communities as leading figures of the scientific process.

A part of our project involves enriching the library, acquiring existing books based on contextualized science (i.e materials that use the context of marginalized societies as examples where we can understand, learn and make science) as well as developing our own material based in the classes, which will be printed as booklets that will be made available in the library. 


## Next Steps

- We aim at including artists of the PPG favela in the development of the project, contributing as course teachers as well as in the development of the course material. 
- We are collaborating with AstroTribe, a project run in India to train astro-tourism guides. We aim at building a bridge between kids in social vulnerability in Rio de Janeiro (Brasil) and Pune (Índia), training astro-guides in the PPG favela.
- In order to sustain these two parts of the project, we plan to submit funding proposals to the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development, as well as other funding bodies in Brazil and abroad.

## How can you get involved?

If you are active in a cultural centre in a favela of Rio, or if you are a scientists at a research/academic institution in the city, get in touch with us!

And also if you work on similar projects elsewhere in Brazil, Latin America and the world: we would like to connect and share our experience.

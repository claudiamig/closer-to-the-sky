## Welcome
This is an astronomy outreach project that aims at building a bridge between favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro and universities/research centers via a mutual enriching approach. Science dissemination and education are brought into the favela while people of the favela are invited to co-create scientific content in collaboration with students, researchers and professors. This approach promotes inclusion, values community knowledge and culture, and provides institutional support and protection to these fragile contexts.

The potential of astronomy to inspire and fascinate scientists, artists and people around the world has been demonstrated to have a restorative power, contributing to people’s mental well-being, especially for marginalised social groups that live under extremely stressful conditions. Hence we intend to apply that potential in Rio's favelas.

## Running Actions
This project is being introduced in Ninho das Águias, a social-cultural project from PPG favela complex, one of the city’s oldest and most densely populated slums, its origin directly linked to the slavery heritage of Brazil’s society. Located in Copacabana, it makes a huge contrast with one of the richest neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro.

Ninho das Águias was designed by the urban artist Acme, dweller of the community. It promotes extracurricular courses for children and teenagers of PPG, such as art and dance classes, as well as classes of astronomy and English. 

### Friday classes

Every Friday, starting May 2023, we offer free astronomy classes at Ninho das Águias for children between 14-19 years old.

### Library
The project hosts a library that aims to stimulate reading among children and tenagers from PPG. Futhermore, it holds material, thanks to funding from the International Astronomical Union, that presents marginalized communities as leading figures of the scientific process.

A part of our project involves enriching the library, acquiring existing books based on contextualized science (i.e materials that use the context of marginalized societies as examples where we can understand, learn and make science) as well as developing our own material based in the classes, which will be printed as booklets that will be made available in the library. 


## Next Steps

- We aim at including artists of the PPG favela in the development of the project, contributing as course teachers as well as in the development of the course material. 
- We are collaborating with AstroTribe, a project run in India to train astro-tourism guides. We aim at building a bridge between kids in social vulnerability in Rio de Janeiro (Brasil) and Pune (Índia), training astro-guides in the PPG favela.
- In order to sustain these two parts of the project, we plan to submit funding proposals to the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development, as well as other funding bodies in Brazil and abroad.

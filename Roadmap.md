# Roadmap
*Co-creating astronomical knowledge in favelas in Rio de Janeiro*

Closer to the Sky is an astronomy outreach project that aims at building a bridge between favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro and universities/research centers via a mutual enriching approach. Science dissemination and education are brought into the favela while people of the favela are invited to co-create scientific content in collaboration with students, researchers and professors. This approach promotes inclusion, values community knowledge and culture, and provides institutional support and protection to these fragile contexts.
